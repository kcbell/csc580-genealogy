My name is John X. Smith. I have three brothers and a sister. My brothers are 
named Joseph, Jake, and James. Jane is my sister. Anne Smith is my mother, 
and my dad's name is Pete. I have three aunts, all on my father's side. Their
names are Hannah, Anna, and Savannah. Savannah is married to a guy named Ken 
Torse. Robert, Savannah and Ken's only son, just turned twelve. My grandfather 
on my mother's side is also named Robert, though we call him Bob. Bob doesn't 
have any kids besides my mom, because my grandmother Sue died during 
childbirth.
